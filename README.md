Advanced Data Analytics for Management Support
The archive of the previous group projects of Advanced Data Analytics for Management Support SS18/19 Humboldt University of Berlin.

The module covers relevant theories and concepts in machine learning against the background of concrete real-world applications in management science. Special emphasize is given to the analysis of textual data and other complex data such as sequences or images. Corresponding data is typically approached using the framework of deep artificial neural networks. 

Topics covered in the module:
- Fundamentals of artificial neural networks 
- Recurrent networks for sequential data processing with applications in finance
- Convolutional neural networks
- Fundamentals of textual data analysis
- Neural network-based text embeddings: word2vec and cousins
- Approaches for topic modeling and sentiment analysis
